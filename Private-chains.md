title: Private Chains
---

Parity supports private chain and private network configuration via [Chain specification](Chain-specification.md) files provided with `--chain`. In addition to the usual [Proof of Work Chains](Proof-of-Work-Chains.md), Parity also includes [Proof of Authority Chains](Proof-of-Authority-Chains.md) which do not require mining.
More details on the available options can be found on the [Pluggable Consensus](Pluggable-Consensus.md) page.
