## 1. Get Parity Signer Mobile App
Get a Smartphone and install the Parity Signer Mobile App making sure that it originated from **Parity Technologies**
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nativesigner)
- [iOs](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/parity-signer/id1218174838)


## 2. Setup or recover an account
When launching the app for the first time, no account has been set up yet. At this stage, you will either want to create an account directly from your mobile device or recover an account already created in Parity Signer Mobile App or [Parity Wallet](https://wiki.parity.io/Parity-Wallet) (Desktop)
 
### Create an account
 
Click on `create account` or `add` in the top right corner, you will be asked to select an image for your account.

In the next step, you will be presented your newly created address with your recovery phrase.
**Write this recovery phrase down and store it in a safe place**.
If your phone gets stolen/broken/forgotten this will be the only way to recover your funds.

You will then be able to enter a pin number of your choice. This pin will be needed later on to unlock your account to sign a transaction.

### Recover an account with your recovery phrase

If you already created an account using either Parity Signer Mobile App or Parity Ethereum Client, and you wish to recover it, you will want to:
- Click on `Create account` or `Add` in the top right-hand corner.
- Select an image.
- Replace the given recovery phrase manually with the one from the account you want to recover.
- Set up a pin code.


## 3. Sign a transaction on MyCrypto

To be able to follow this tutorial and send Ether from this freshly created account on Parity Signer Mobile App, you will obviously need to get some Ether to send. Use the account address or the QR code available on your account main view to get Ether. Follow the steps 3. and 4. of the [Parity Wallet tutorial](Parity-Signer-Mobile-App-Parity-Wallet-tutorial#3-attach-a-parity-signer-mobile-app-account-to-parity-wallet) if you are not sure how to achieve it.

Assuming that your account now has funds, you will be able to send securely some Ether to anyone, without transferring your private key, and without needing any internet connection on your mobile phone.

To do so, visit [https://mycrypto.com/](https://mycrypto.com/), click on `Parity Signer` and allow the website to access your webcam. This is required to scan the QR code from your phone.

On your phone, select the account you want to send Ether from and make sure that the QR is fully displayed on the phone before facing your phone's screen to your webcam.

MyCrypto will now allow you to enter the address of the account you want to send Ether to as well as the amount of gas. Make sure to try with a small amount of Ether first before sending larger amounts of money. Click on `Send transaction` when you're done.

You will now be presented with a QR code that represents the transaction. Since this transaction is sending funds from your Parity Signer Mobile App account, only this account (sitting on your phone) is able to sign and authorize this transaction. This is what we'll do in the next steps:
- From the Parity Signer Mobile App, click on `Scan transaction QR` and scan the QR code presented by MyCrypto.
- Review the transaction addresses and the amount to send. The amount and addresses must match what you've entered in MyCrypto. If you got phished, this is where you can realize it and reject the transaction.
- Once you're sure, scroll down and click `Next` to enter your pin.

Your phone has now *signed the transaction offline* using your Parity Signer Mobile App account private key. The QR code that is now displayed on your phone represents a signed transaction that can be broadcasted. We will do this in the next steps:
- On MyCrypto, click on `Scan`.
- Allow the website to access your webcam.
- Face your phone's display to your webcam for MyCrypto to be able to read the signed transaction.
- Verify one last time that the account addresses are correct as well as the amount to transfer on MyCrypto.
- Click `Send` on MyCrypto.
- Congrats you just sent Ether from an air-gapped account :)
